# glsl-playground 

Focus on how [glsl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL_Shading_Language) works instead of how communication between the CPU and graphics card work.
This program allows its user to run glsl experiments with live feedback. Inspired by [shadertoy](https://shadertoy.com)

## Features

- Live reloading
- Access to certain uniforms

## Tech Stack

- [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/)
- [GLEW](http://glew.sourceforge.net/)
- [OPENGL](https://www.opengl.org/)

## Building and running

For windows users, run the `build.bat` script. Ensure you have run the [vs developer cmd](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/reference/command-prompt-powershell?view=vs-2019)

I'm yet to add the `build.sh` for linux user. Hopefully soon.
